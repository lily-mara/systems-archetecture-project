[x] Exit the program. The application should offer the posibility of asking the user if s/he wants to exiting warning that all data are going to be lost.
[x] Insert. This function is in charge of inserting a new book by a command line option. The new element is to be allocated in dynamic memory to be be able to be modified at runtime.
[x] Show a summary. This option is in charge of listing all books included in the system, followed by at most 20 characters from the title (in order to keep the title short), and by the id of the author.
[x] Show publication info. This option is in charge of showing all information from a book included in the system. The way to access this information is by means of the identifier (ID) associated to each book.
[ ] Modification of a book. This option will allow you to modify the records of a book whose ID is provided in the command line. In a situation with several books with the same ID, only one is modified (i.e. the first).
[x] Remove a book from its ID. This menu option is in charge of removing a book reference from the system given an ID provided from the command line. If several books share the same ID, then only the first listed book is removed.
[x] Export to a file. This option is in charge of storing all books stored in memory in persistent storage (i.e. a file) with fwrite. For the evaluation, data will be stored always in `data_demo.sbm` binary file.
[x] Import from a file. This option is in charge of getting data store in permanent medium (e.g. a file used in the export option) to store this data in memory using fread. For the evaluation, data will be read always from `data_demo.sbm` file.
[ ] Show corrupt records. The function will display all registries where two books share the same id (ID). It will also consider as a corrupt record, those books with the same id of an author but with with differences in names and/or surnames.
[x] Activate autosave. This functionality activates an autosaving system, implemented with POSIX threads, in charge of saving a modified list to a file called `AUTOSAVE_demo.sbm`, each time there are any modifications in the applications. Once autosaving is activated, it is active until the program finishes.
[ ] After selection an operation, additional data may be introduced through the keyboard. When the operation finishes, the main textual menu is shown again and the application waits for a new command from the user. The user may enter Crtl-D to return to the main menu without finishing the operation.
[ ] The application must be robust, that is, it should recover with no problems if at some point the user introduces incorrect data (letters when numbers are expected, an empty string, an empty line, an incorrect file name, an empty file, etc.).
